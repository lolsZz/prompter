# prompter: Advanced AI Prompt Engineering Application

prompter is an innovative application that leverages sophisticated prompting techniques to enable users to craft advanced, context-aware prompts for AI interactions. Inspired by the [SuperPrompt project](https://github.com/NeoVertex1/SuperPrompt) and building upon the structure and logic of tm_prompt.xml, prompter aims to revolutionize the way we interact with AI models.

## Features

- Implementation of a powerful tag system and logic based on tm_prompt_improved.xml
- User-friendly interface for creating and managing complex prompts
- Dynamic prompt generation based on context and user inputs
- Integration with popular AI models for real-time testing
- Prompt version control and collaboration features
- Performance analytics for prompt effectiveness
